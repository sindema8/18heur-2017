# Heuristics 2017

Repository accompanying the 2017 Heuristics course at Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## Structure of the repository

* `notebooks/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks with all the materials related to the classes, organized as `YYYYMMDD-*.{ipynb,html,py}` where `YYYYMMDD` is date of the class and:
   * `*.ipynb` file contains the IPython notebook - it can be rendered directly on GitHub or opened locally in Jupyter,
   * `*.html` file contains static version of the notebook for viewing in any web browser, without Jupyter,
   * `*.py` contains plain Python source code version of the notebook - only because it can be easily referenced in e.g. a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
* `src/` folder contains all source codes which can be imported and re-used.
