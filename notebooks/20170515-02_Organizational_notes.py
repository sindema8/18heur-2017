# ## Recommended topics for your own work
# 
# ### 1. Tuning of implemented heuristics on implemented objective functions
# 
# It is absolutely OK to re-use any materials from the classes, including source codes. But beware: simple re-running of existing heuristics and obj. functions, even on larger parameter space, is **not enough**.  Large scale experiments should be accompanied by reasonable analysis of the results and thoughtful conclusions!
# 
# ### 2. Implementation and tuning of new heuristics and/or new objective functions
# 
# Reasonable study of heuristic/obj. function parameters, including comparison with selected referential methods, will be required as output.
# 
# ### 3. Improvement of existing code base
# 
# By implementing unit tests, better handling of edge cases, improving documentation, packaging etc. Any work in this regard should be discussed in advance.

# ## How to submit your work
# 
# As a Jupyter notebook (including .IPYNB, .HTML and .PY version), ideally. Regular PDF is OK as well. Just name the files reasonably (`HEURISTIKY.pdf` is a bad name) and any form readable on a mobile device will be appreciated.
# 
# Furthermore, consider the following technical ways of submission:
# 
# 1. [Pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is definitely the favored alternative
# 2. Via e-mail
# 
# Last, but not least, English language is preferred.

# ## Schedule for the rest of semester
# 
# TBD.
